Hi all welcome to our second tutorial on Tidalcycles

In this tutorial we will explain some of the fundamentals of Tidal and start to write our first patterns.

Let's start from this line of code wich is one of the simplest things you can write inside Tidal

d1 $ sound "bd"

The first character highlited in blue is d1 wich represent the first channel inside Superdirt, d2 represent the second one and so on.

The second character is the dollar, to explain how the dollar works inside Tidal and Haskell you can consider that this to are the same

a $ b
a (b)

So what the dollar does is actually to apply a function to something else
